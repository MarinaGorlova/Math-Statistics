    "To support data-driven decision-making in education, it's important to try to ascertain the effect of particular activities on their participants. One possible way to do it would be to compare certain factors for those who took part in the activity and for those who did'nt. These factors may include KPIs, year-end evaluations, the success of adaptation process at a company, different types of engagement, and the ultimate metric for employees' satisfaction - staff turnover."
